### Creating an `on-command` hook and asking for specific data:

Sought for realization: update type [message],
conatining data on entities list [entities],
containing an entity data list,
having key-value pair of :|type| "bot_command".

The search of it comes along with a task: 
Accquire date sent and first_name of the sender.

List of tasks is the heart of the idea, where as 
pretenders to the tasks' results are symlinked to
them in a way that once some pretender's conditions 
are surely unmet for the 

There are three types of values associated with a key in the plist:
1. Plain value	[non-list value]
2. Array  		[plists in a list]
3. Object 		[plist]

From theese types derive connections to be generalized and utilized in the event system:
1. A key in an object [].
2. A value of an object's parameter in an array named after it's key.
3. A value in an object named after its key.



Creation of two similar hooks is imposible for the task of 
passing overlaping but separate datasets to different functions.
One would simply add second needed data set to the task registered.
